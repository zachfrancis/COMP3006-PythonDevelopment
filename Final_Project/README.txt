Question posed: What is the correlation of rabies cases in humans compared to animals in countries with a high incidence of human rabies cases?

File Contents and who did what:
1) animal_human_RABV.py 
    - Program integrates human rabies data and animal rabies data and generates 3 plots comparing the relationships between cases/exposure in humans and cases in animals
    - unittest: 'test_animal_human_RABV.py'
    - 50/50 collaboration between Zach and Ash
    - 'Combined_Plots.png' shows the plots generated by this program

2) logger.py
    - Logger used in rabv_animal.py and animal_human_RABV.py
    - Written by Ash

3) rabies_analysis.py
    - Analysis of human data
    - Uses data from csv file: rabies_epidemic_data.csv
    - Data source: https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003709#sec016
    - unittest: 'test_rabies_analysis.py'
    - Written by Zach
    - Related PNGs of plots, thier, CSV outputs, and log files are located in Zach_Outputs 

4) rabv_animal.py
    - Analysis of animal data focusing on China due to a more robust dataset available in China
    - Uses data from csv file: rabv_animal.py
    - unittest: 'test_rabv_animal.py'
    - Data source: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/12/20-0303_article
    - Written by Ash
    - Related PNGs of plots, CSV outputs, and log files located in Ash_Outputs

Conclusion:
The general trend is that both rabies cases in animals and rabies cases/exposure in humans seems to be increasing over the years. 
This is an interesting result because access to the very effective animal-rabies vaccine, and post exposure prophylaxis for humans 
has improved over the years. As such it's counterintuitive that cases/exposure would be increasing. 

There does not seem to be a consistent pattern to correlate human incidence with animal incidence. This is also interesting because 
humans contract rabies virus from an animal source. The expectation is that there would be a correlation between the two. That there 
doesn't seem to be could be a product of lack of surveillance in animals, under reporting in animal cases, and/or lack of access to a 
centralized reporting system to acquire a complete and accurate data set.
